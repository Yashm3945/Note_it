Note-It is a Node.js based productivity tracker application built using Express and the EJS templating engine to provide dynamic and user-friendly task management. The app implements full CRUD operations for recording daily tasks, monitoring completion status, and tracking personal progress, with middleware such as URL-encoded parsing, static file serving from the public folder, and REST-style delete handling through method-override. It was structured following an MVC-like approach with clearly separated routes, views, and assets, and designed in our discussion to be extendable with MongoDB for persistent storage, enabling users to analyze productivity trends and improve time management and overall efficiency.
